        content: `MBA programs use several types of essay prompts to learn about you:

**Goals Essay** — This is one of the most common types. You'll be asked about your short-term and long-term career goals, why you need an MBA to achieve them, and why now is the right time. Admissions committees want to see clarity and realism.

**Leadership Essay** — Schools look for evidence of leadership potential. These essays often ask for specific examples of when you led a team, drove change, or made a difficult decision. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your response.

**"Why This School" Essay** — This is your chance to show you've done your research. Explain why the school's specific resources, culture, and community align with your goals. Be specific — mention professors, clubs, or programs that genuinely interest you.

**Personal/Behavioral Essay** — These prompts explore your character, values, and how you handle challenges. Questions about failure, teamwork, or "tell me about yourself" fall into this category. Be authentic and reflective.`

**Opening** — Start with a hook that captures attention. This could be a specific moment, a surprising fact, or a bold statement. Avoid generic openings like "Since I was young..."

**Body** — Each paragraph should have a clear point. Use specific examples and quantified results. Show, don't tell — let your actions speak for themselves.

**Conclusion** — End with forward momentum. Connect back to your goals and explain why this school is the next step. Leave the reader confident in your direction.`

1. **Review your story bank** — Go through all your saved stories. Categorize them by theme (leadership, teamwork, challenge, growth).

2. **Match stories to prompts** — Map each essay prompt to 2-3 relevant stories from your bank.

3. **Draft an outline** — Before writing, create a simple structure. What are the key points for each paragraph?

4. **Fill in details** — Write your first draft focusing on content. Don't worry about word count yet.

5. **Get feedback** — Share with trusted colleagues, friends, or an MBA coach. Fresh eyes catch issues you miss.

6. **Revise and polish** — Cut unnecessary words, tighten sentences, and ensure your voice shines through.`

I organized daily stand-ups, redistributed tasks based on each engineer's strengths, and personally mentored two junior developers. We launched on time with 40% fewer bugs than previous releases."

*Why it works:* Specific situation, clear actions, quantified results. Shows leadership through behavior, not just claiming to be a leader.

**Weak Example:**
"I am a great leader who can motivate teams. Under my guidance, our team achieved success. I learned a lot from this experience and would bring these skills to business school."

**Strictly One Page** — Admissions committees expect a concise document. Every line must earn its place. Cut fluff and focus on impact.

*After:* "Led a cross-functional team of 12 to redesign our customer onboarding flow, reducing time-to-value by 30% and increasing customer satisfaction scores by 15 points."

**Direct Supervisor** — This is ideal if you have a strong relationship. They can speak to your daily work, growth, and leadership potential. If you've recently been promoted or received recognition, they can validate that.

**Someone Who Knows You Well** — Quality trumps title. A manager who can provide specific examples of your work is better than a senior executive who barely knows your name.

**Can Speak to Specific Examples** — The best recommenders have concrete stories to tell. Choose people who've seen you in action, not just heard about you.

**Famous People Who Don't Know You** — A recommendation from a CEO who can't provide specific examples is worthless. Admissions committees see through this.

**Family Members** — Never. It's unprofessional and provides no value.

**Peers** — Unless specifically allowed (some schools accept peer recommendations), avoid this. Colleagues can't speak to your professional potential.

**Suggest Themes** — If you want them to emphasize leadership, tell them. If you want them to highlight your analytical skills, give examples.

**Set Timeline Expectations** — Give them at least 4-6 weeks. Don't spring this on them last minute.

**Choosing the Wrong Person** — Just because someone is senior doesn't mean they're the right choice. Pick someone who truly knows your work.

**Not Following Up** — Send gentle reminders. They're doing you a favor.

4. **Set timeline expectations** — Explain deadlines clearly. Ask when they can have it done.

**Blind vs. Informed** — In blind interviews, the interviewer hasn't seen your application. You'll need to cover your background more thoroughly. In informed interviews, they've read your file, so you can dive deeper into specifics.

**On-Campus vs. Virtual** — Both have similar expectations. For virtual, test your technology, lighting, and background beforehand. Dress professionally.
